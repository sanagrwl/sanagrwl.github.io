title: And we are up!!

Finally after so many years of development, I am going to start posting.

### Why after so many years?

Well,

* I have learned a few things.
* I have become opinionated about few things. Eg: Ruby as a language.
* I was shy to talk to internet. I was only listening.
* When people will search and find my posts, they will believe me, since everything on internet is true. (I hope you know sarcasm.)


Thanks!
