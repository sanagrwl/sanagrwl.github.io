I have been typing on ErgoDox for about 6 months now. And I may have configured it probably 10 times. I also own <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/" target="_blank">Advantage Kinesis</a>, and I have used that for good 3 - 4 years. I loved my kinesis, until I met ErgoDox.

### Configuration

All my configurations are done using <a href="https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/layouts/default/latest/0" target="_blank">graphical configurator</a>. My configuration can be found <a href="https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/layouts/XjY9/latest/0" target="_blank">here</a>. Although, I am considering using <a href="https://github.com/qmk/qmk_configurator" target="_blank">QMK configurator</a> for tap dance and other fine tuning.

One of the great things about ErgoDox is the dual function keys and layers. All of my `asdf` and `jkl;` keys are dual keys. Tap them, and they act normal, hold them they become modifier keys. Although, I feel like dual keys are slower than normal keys. One of the other reasons I want to tweak it using QMK.

My `TT1` button works as a tap and hold button for switching layers. Tap once, switch to Layer 1, Tap again go back to Layer 0. I can accomplish the same by simply holding and then releasing the button. Simple. And you can have a lot of layers. 

I don't have any crazy setup. It works for me and I have been constantly tweaking it based on my needs. And that is the main reason why I love this keyboard.

Coolio!
